                <h2>What is SSL?</h2>
                <p class="first">
                   SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security technology for establishing
                   an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. SSL ensures that
                   all data passed between the web server and browsers remain private and
                   integral.

                <h2>What is TLS</h2>
                <p class="second">
                   TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the successor to SSL. Its a cryptographic
                   protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. 
                   TLS is more secure than SSL and is commonly referred to as SSL, even though 
                   modern implementations use TLS.

                <h2>How can I tell that my website is secure?</h2>
                <p class="third">
                   By looking for "HTTPS" in the URL instead of "HTTP." Additionally, 
                   modern browsers often show a padlock icon next to the URL in the address bar,
                   indicating that the site uses SSL/TLS encryption. I  can click this padlock
                   to view details about the site's security.

                <h2>What does it mean to be secure?</h2>
                <p class="forth">
                   A secure webpage uses encryption to protect data exchanged between
                   the user and the server, ensuring that sensitive information like personal 
                   data, passwords, and credit card details cannot be intercepted or tampered
                   with by malicious actors.

                <h2>What is encryption and why i do care?</h2>
                <p class="fifth">
                   Encryption is the process of converting information into a code to prevent
                   unauthorized access. It ensures that only authorized parties can read the data.
                   Encryption is crucial for protecting personal data, maintaining privacy,
                   and securing online transactions.

                <h2>Do the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when we're talking about secure websites?</h2>
                <p class="sixth">
                   Yes, they matter. HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) indicates
                   that the website is using SSL/TLS encryption, making it secure. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) 
                   does not use encryption, which means data transferred is vulnerable to interception.

                <h2>What is an SSL certificate authority?</h2>
                <p class="seventh">
                    An SSL Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted organization that issues SSL/TLS certificates.
                    The CA verifies the identity of the certificate requester and provides
                    a certificate that helps establish a secure connection.
